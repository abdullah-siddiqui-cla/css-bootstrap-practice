# Bootstrap Practices
The purpose of this practice is to get comfortable with Bootstrap classes and **get used to documenting**

Create a page using Bootstrap and make it look like as close as possible to the preview images.

## Documentation
- [Bootstrap official docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

By using Bootstrap documentation, the practice can be finished in less than 45 minutes ;)

**NOTE**: The page should be developed ONLY using bootstrap. No custom css should be applied
